# PYGEONS DEMONSTRATION #2:
# TEMPORALLY SMOOTHING GPS DATA

# This script demonstrates how to temporally smooth GPS data for a
# single station.  This station, MIDA, recorded displacements
# associated with the 2004 Parkfield earthquake and the 2003 San
# Simeon earthquake. By specifying the date of the earthquakes, we
# can prevent pygeons from smoothing over these events.

# convert the csv file to an HDF5 file. This file was downloaded from
# www.unavco.org and uses the CSV file format established by UNAVCO
# and the Plate Boundary Observatory. This file can be read by
# specifying the file type as "pbo_csv".

# the earthquake dates are the first day that the displacements are
# observed in the timeseries

# temporal cutoff frequency in days^-1. 0.033 corresponds to a
# wavelength of one month
