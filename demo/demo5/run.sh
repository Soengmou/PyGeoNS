# It is assumed that the displacement timeseries consists of:
#   - A linear polynomial (linear)
#   - Sinusoids with annual and semiannual periods (seasonal)
#   - A step at the time of the EMC earthquake (step)
#   - A linear postseismic trend (ramp)
#   - Integrated Brownian motion starting after the earthquake (ibm)
#
# We fit these terms to the observations with *pygeons tgpr*. This
# function takes at least three arguments; the name of the data file,
# a string specifying each component of the model, and a list of
# hyperparameters for the model. The components that require the user
# to specify a hyperparameter are *step*, *ramp*, and *ibm*. *step*
# and *ramp* require the user to specify their start times. *ibm*
# requires a scale parameter and a start time. These four
# hyperparameters are specified in the same order that the components
# were specified in. The start times are all the time of the EMC
# earthquake (in MJD), and the scale parameter for *ibm* is 50
# mm/yr^-1.5.
