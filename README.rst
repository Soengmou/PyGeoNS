PyGeoNS (Python-based Geodetic Network Strain software)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What PyGeoNS can do
===================
PyGeoNS is a suite of command line executables that are used to smooth 
and differentiate GPS data in both space and time.  This analysis is 
performed in a Bayesian framework, using Gaussian process regression, 
and thus the uncertainties on the data products are well-quantified 
and meaningful. This software is primarily intended for estimating 
time dependent strain rates from GPS networks with several hundred 
stations.

What PyGeoNS does not do
========================
The core processing algorithms used by PyGeoNS come from the *RBF* 
python package, which can be found `here 
<http://www.github.com/treverhines/RBF>`_. PyGeoNS mostly does the 
requisit data munging, and it provides functions to interactively view 
and clean the data. There are several assumptions that have been hard 
coded into PyGeoNS which may make this software inapplicable to your 
project. In particular, if the Earth's curvature is non-negligible in 
your study region, then the map projection used by PyGeoNS 
(transverse-mercator) would not be appropriate. Additionally, PyGeoNS 
is designed to handle data with daily sampling rates. Less frequent 
sampling rates can be handled, such as for campaign GPS, but PyGeoNS 
cannot use data that has been sampled at higher frequencies. If these 
limitations conflict with your project needs, then it may be better to 
directly interface with the *RBF* package. Finally, the plotting 
functions in PyGeoNS are intended to be a convenient way of 
interactively viewing GPS data, but they are not intended to be 
customizable to meet everyones plotting needs. 

Installation
============
PyGeoNS requires the standard scientific python packages, which can be 
found in the base Anaconda python installation 
(http://www.continuum.io/downloads). Additionally, PyGeoNS requires 
that the *RBF* package be installed 
(http://www.github.com/treverhines/RBF). Once these dependencies are 
satisfied, this package can be downloaded and installed with the 
following commands

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone http://www.github.com/treverhines/PyGeoNS.git
  $ python setupy.py install

Executables
===========
PyGeoNS contains the following command line executable functions. Call 
these functions with a '-h' flag to see more information.

* ``pygeons-toh5`` : Converts data from a text file to an hdf5 file.
* ``pygeons-totext`` : Converts data from a hdf5 file to a csv file.
* ``pygeons-view`` : Starts an interactive map view and time series 
  view of vector data sets (e.g. displacements, deformation gradients, 
  etc.).
* ``pygeons-strain`` : Starts an interactive map view and time series 
  view of strain. 
* ``pygeons-clean`` : Starts the interactive cleaner, which is used to 
  manually remove jumps and outliers.
* ``pygeons-crop`` : Bounds the spatial and temporal extent of the data 
  set.
* ``pygeons-tgpr`` : Temporally smooths and differentiates a data set.
* ``pygeons-sgpr`` : Spatially smooths and differentiates a data set.

Text Data Format
================
PyGeoNS is currently able to read three text file formats: PBO csv 
files, PBO pos files, and a csv file format designed for PyGeoNS. See 
www.unavco.org for information on the PBO data file formats. An 
example of each file format is provided below.

PyGeoNS CSV
-----------
The PyGeoNS CSV file only contains information that PyGeoNS uses, 
making it unambigous which fields can influence the results. For 
example, there is no reference frame information in the PyGeoNS csv 
format because PyGeoNS does not ever use that information.

HDF5 Data Format
================
To cut out overhead associated with reading and writing, most PyGeoNS 
executables read from and write to HDF5 files. Any of the above text 
file formats can be converted to an HDF5 file by doing the following. 
First, concatenate the data files for each station into one file 
separated by ``***``. For example, if the data files are in the 
current directory and contain a ``.csv`` extension then they can be 
concatenated with the following sed incantation

.. code-block::

  $ sed -s 'a***' *.csv | sed '$d' > data.csv 

Second, convert the new text file to and HDF5 file with the PyGeoNS 
command ``pygeons-toh5`` and use the ``--file_type`` flag followed by 
either ``csv``, ``pbocsv``, or ``pbopos``. By default, this is set to 
``csv``, indicating the file is a PyGeoNS csv file. The generated HDF5 
file can be read using, for example, the h5py package in python. Each 
HDF5 contain the following entries

* ``time`` : Array of integers with shape (Nt,). Integer values of 
  modified Julian dates.
* ``id`` : Array of strings with shape (Nx,). 4-character IDs for each 
  station.
* ``longitude``, ``latitude`` : Array of floats with shape (Nx,). 
  Coordinates for each station.
* ``east``, ``north``, ``vertical`` : Array of floats with shape 
  (Nt,Nx). These are the data components. The units should be in terms 
  of meters and days and should be consistent with the values 
  specified for ``space_exponent`` and ``time_exponent``. For example, 
  if ``time_exponent`` is -1 and *space_exponent* is 1 then the units 
  should be in meters per day. If data is missing for a particular 
  time and station then it should be set to nan.
* ``east_std_dev``, ``north_std_dev``, ``vertical_std_dev`` : Array of 
  floats with shape (Nt,Nx). One standard deviation uncertainties for 
  each component of the data.  The units should be the same as those 
  used for the data components. If data is missing for a particular 
  time and station then it should be set to inf.
* ``time_exponent`` : Integer. This indicates the power of the time 
  units for the data. -1 indicates that the data is a rate, -2 indicates 
  an acceleration, etc.
* ``space_exponent`` : Integer. Indicates the power of the spatial 
  units for the data.
